| [Calculations_approxValid.np](numerics/Calculations_approxValid.nb) | Mathematica code that solves TIPGs corresponding to cheat penalty coin flipping; given a grid, penalty Î›, and points on which to estimate validity. However, the result is only "approximately valid"| 
| [ProjectColumn2.m](numerics/ProjectColumn2.m) | A python notebook that projects the "approximately valid" solution onto a valid solution; this is what we finally report |  
| [matrices_TIPG.txt](numerics/Matrices_TIPG.txt) | A text file that contains all the results reported in the manuscript |
