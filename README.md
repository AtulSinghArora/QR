## Update | Weak Coin Flipping @ QIP 2017, Delft
Navigate to the folder by the name QIP2017_WCF. I will add a direct link later.

Intended to host the information I'd like to convey using QR codes primarily in talks and posters.

## Usage
Navigate by opening the folders, the folder names above should be self explanatory. You can download any file you like by clicking on it and asking for a "raw" version.
