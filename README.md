## QR Repository
Intended to host the information I'd like to convey using QR codes primarily in talks and posters. There is a remote possiblity of my website — https://atulsingharora.github.io/ — containing a better representation of this.

## Usage
Navigate by opening the folders, the folder names above should be self explanatory. You can download any file you like by clicking on it and asking for a "raw" version.

## Archive
*	Weak Coin Flipping @ QIP 2018, Delft;
	Navigate to the folder by the name [QIP2018_WCF](./QIP2018_WCF)
