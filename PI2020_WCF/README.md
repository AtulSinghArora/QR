# PI Talk, March 2020 | Quantum Weak Coin Flipping

### Introduction

Thank you for visiting the page. You might just be the only visitor. Congratulations!

The talk was based on two works and some unpublished results. You can find the description of TEF, the 1/10 bias protocol and the EMA algorithm [here](../WCF) and results about the analytic solution [here](../WCF2) (we intend to update the article with the solution we presented).
