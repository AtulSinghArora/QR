# Atul Singh ARORA

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Caltech](https://iqim.caltech.edu/people/postdocs/), working under the supervision of Thomas VIDICK (presently at [Weizmann](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/)). 

Given my training in physics, I am fascinated by the emergence of physical insight from the application of quantum mechanics to solving computational or cryptographic tasks. I was initially drawn to the field by the possibility of having information theoretic security in certain cryptographic settings (e.g. key distribution, coin flipping). Currently, I am excited by the prospect of understanding and testing various aspects of quantum mechanics under computational assumptions (e.g. collapse binding, compressed oracle simulation, quantum depth).

## Education

For my doctoral dissertation (Sep 2022), I was advised by Jérémie ROLAND at [Université libre de Bruxelles](http://quic.ulb.ac.be/members/past). I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's (May 2016) from [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/students/people-sublinks/bs-ms-2011-batch), (India). I majored in physics and my master's thesis advisor was Prof Arvind.

</summary>

> We give a comprehensive characterisation of the computational power of shallow quantum circuits combined with classical computation. Specifically, for classes of search problems, we show that the following statements hold, relative to a random oracle:  
(a) $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}} \neq \mathsf{BQP}$. This refutes Jozsa's conjecture [QIP 05] in the random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson's ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing.  
(b) $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}} \nsubseteq \mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}$ and $\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}} \nsubseteq \mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}}$. This shows that there is a subtle interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation. In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive measurements.  
(c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth. Our proof of quantum depth can be instantiated using the recent proof of quantumness construction by Yamakawa and Zhandry [FOCS 22].
