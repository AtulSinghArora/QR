## Atul Singh ARORA

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Caltech](https://iqim.caltech.edu/people/postdocs/), working under the supervision of Thomas VIDICK. 

Given my training in physics, I am fascinated by the emergence of physical insight from the application of quantum mechanics to solving computational or cryptographic tasks. I was initially drawn to the field by the possibility of having information theoretic security in certain cryptographic settings. Currently, I am excited by the prospect of understanding and testing various aspects of quantum mechanics under computational assumptions.

For my doctoral dissertation, which I completed in Sep 2020, I was advised by Jérémie ROLAND at [Université libre de Bruxelles](http://quic.ulb.ac.be/members/past). I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's from [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/students/people-sublinks/bs-ms-2011-batch), (India). I had majored in physics and my master's thesis advisor was Prof Arvind.
