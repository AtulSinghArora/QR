## Atul Singh ARORA

I am a postdoctoral researcher, working under the supervision of Thomas VIDICK (Caltech/Weizmann). For my doctoral dissertation, which I completed in Sep 2020, I was advised by Jérémie ROLAND (Université libre de Bruxelles). 

I am fascinated by the emergence of physical insight from the application of quantum mechanics to solving computational or cryptographic tasks. I was initially drawn to the field by the possibility of having information theoretic security in certain cryptographic settings. Currently, I am excited by the prospect of understanding and testing various aspects of quantum mechanics under computational assumptions.
