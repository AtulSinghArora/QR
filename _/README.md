# Atul Singh ARORA

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Caltech](https://iqim.caltech.edu/people/postdocs/), working under the supervision of Thomas VIDICK (presently at [Weizmann](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/)). 

Given my training in physics, I am fascinated by the emergence of physical insight from the application of quantum mechanics to solving computational or cryptographic tasks. I was initially drawn to the field by the possibility of having information theoretic security in certain cryptographic settings (e.g. key distribution, coin flipping). Currently, I am excited by the prospect of understanding and testing various aspects of quantum mechanics under computational assumptions (e.g. collapse binding, compressed oracle simulation, quantum depth).

## Education

For my doctoral dissertation (Sep 2022), I was advised by Jérémie ROLAND at [Université libre de Bruxelles](http://quic.ulb.ac.be/members/past). I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's (May 2016) from [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/students/people-sublinks/bs-ms-2011-batch), (India). I majored in physics and my master's thesis advisor was Prof Arvind.
